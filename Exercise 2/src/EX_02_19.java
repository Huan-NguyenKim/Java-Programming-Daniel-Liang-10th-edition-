/**
 * (Geometry: distance of two points) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and displays their distance between them.
 * The formula for computing the distance is
 *        __________________________
 *      âˆš(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
 *
 * Note that you can use Math.pow(a, 0.5) to compute 2a.
